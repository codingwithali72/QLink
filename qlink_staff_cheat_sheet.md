# 🏁 QLink Staff Cheat Sheet (Day 1)

Welcome to QLink! This system is designed to keep your clinic organized and keep patients informed. Here is exactly how to run the queue.

## 🌅 Starting the Day
1. Click **"Start Live Queue"** to open the session. 
2. Patients can now scan your QR code to join the line automatically.

## 🩺 Managing the Queue
The dashboard shows everyone waiting in order. **Do not shout names.** The system WhatsApps them and updates their phone automatically.

- **[NEXT]** — Calls the person at the top of the list into the cabin. Their phone will buzz saying *"It's your turn!"*. click this **ONLY** when the doctor is ready for them.
- **[SERVED]** — The consultation is over. The patient has left the cabin. This removes them from the active queue.

### ⚠️ What if a patient isn't at the clinic when you click NEXT?
Click **[SKIP (No-Show)]**. They are temporarily removed from the main line so the doctor isn't kept waiting.

### 🔙 What if a Skipped patient comes back late?
Find them in the **"Skipped/Recent"** tab and click **[RECALL]**. 
*Rule:* Recalled patients do NOT go to the back of the line. They are placed **behind the currently serving patient**. They will go NEXT.

### 🚑 Emergency Walk-ins
Click **"New Token"**, enter their details, and check the **"Priority / Emergency"** box.
*Rule:* They will bypass the entire waiting room and be placed immediately behind the currently serving patient. All other patients will see a note on their phone: *"A priority case was added. Your position shifted by 1."*

## ✏️ Fixing Mistakes
- **Typo in phone/name?** Hover over the patient's card and click the **Pencil icon** to edit their details.
- **Clicked the wrong button?** Find the patient in the log and click **[UNDO]**. It will put them exactly back where they were.

## ☕ Lunch Breaks & Pauses
Click **"Pause Queue"** when the doctor takes a break. 
- Patients can still join the queue (scan QR).
- But their phones will say *"Queue Paused"* and the ETA will hide so they don't panic.
- Click **"Resume Queue"** when the doctor returns.

## 🚨 The Amber/Red Warning Bar
If the "Currently Serving" patient has been inside the cabin for more than **5 minutes**, an amber warning bar will appear. At **10 minutes**, it pulses red.
*Why?* It usually means the receptionist forgot to click `[SERVED]` and `[NEXT]`. The system cannot update patient ETAs if you forget to click NEXT. **Always click NEXT promptly.**

## 🌙 Closing the Clinic
At the end of the day, click **"Close Queue Session"**. You must type "CLOSE" to confirm.
- Anyone left in the `WAITING` list will be marked as cancelled. Ensure the waiting room is empty before doing this.

## 🛡️ Anti-Spam Security
- A patient CANNOT scan the QR code from home to book tomorrow. The limit resets daily.
- A patient CANNOT book 5 tokens with the same phone number.
- Any abuse is automatically blocked.
